It achieves this by breaking down rigid, complex IT silos around your network, data center and storage infrastructures and transforming them into adaptive pools of resources that can be shared by many applications and managed as a service. It also includes embedded security at both the perimeter and core of your network, as well as power and cooling management capabilities so systems and facilities work together. Taken together, converged infrastructure accelerates the provisioning of IT services and applications to deliver value to the business in a systematic, repeatable, and secure environment.
