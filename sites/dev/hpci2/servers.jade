            h2 Focusing on Servers to Deliver the Cloud Through a Converged Infrastructure
            p
              | Many savvy IT organizations are recognizing that converged infrastructure is a critical enabling technology for successful cloud computing deployments. In a converged cloud the infrastructures for development and operations are consistently visible, accessible and manageable. Standardization allows portability of services across deployment models and IT elements are shared and pooled for quick assembly and disassembly to support advanced agility and user flexibility.

              | In cloud environments your servers must be able to support the highest levels of virtualization, whether they are rack, blade, tower or scalable systems. It is important to make sure that servers supporting your cloud deployments are the most up-to-date and highest performing machines in your infrastructure. You also may want to consider a faster refresh cycle for the cloud.
            p
              | Why such a critical focus on new servers in your converged infrastructure? Because today’s HP ProLiant Gen8 servers are designed to address data center requirements in the cloud era, featuring embedded automation and intelligent management features that change the paradigm for cloud performance and manageability.  Key innovations achieved in Gen8 servers are simply not available in earlier generations. With the intelligence built into today’s ProLiant servers through the HP ProActive Insight Architecture, IT can eliminate tedious tasks while dramatically boosting application performance through automation and optimization.
            p
              | It is also important to have a converged infrastructure that integrates with your existing environment and can manage both physical and virtual machines. Solutions such as the HP CloudSystem Matrix greatly reduce complexity for the cloud by combining hardware, storage, software and services into one solution. Read on to learn why focusing on server hardware is critical in deploying the cloud through a converged infrastructure.
