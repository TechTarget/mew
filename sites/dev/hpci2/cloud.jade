              | When scoping cloud solutions, most organizations face a common set of challenges related to virtual infrastructure limitations, the lack of scale and elasticity in "cloud-in-a-box" solutions, ad hoc cloud implementations with siloed management tools and processes, and lack of security controls. Addressing these challenges requires a hybrid delivery strategy that leverages cloud services as an integral part of your service delivery strategy. This
